# EasyAstronomy-AstronomyResourcesRepository
 This is a website where I compile useful information and resources for those looking to get a basic understanding of astronomy. The user will be able to look up astromony-related terms (black hole, gravity, dwarf planet, etc.) through a search bar and the appropriate information and resources will be displayed.
